<p>Printed forms of enquiry and letters of instructions were
sent to twenty-six lighthouses on the east coast of Scotland.
Thirteen stations have sent in returns, and thirteen have either
sent in none, or have returned blank forms, owing to unusual
scarcity of birds. The stations from which co-operation was asked
are the following, commencing with the most northerly. Those
from which returns have been received are marked with a *.</p>

<p>A general scarcity of birds is reported by a great majority of
the observers on our east coast, which partly accounts for the
absence of returns from several stations. Those sent in have been
carefully prepared by the various reporters so far as materials
allowed. Excluding Swans, Geese, Ducks, and Rock-birds, notes
have been made on about twenty-eight different species.</p>


<h3 id="SEPARATE_REPORT_OF_EACH_SPECIES_OBSERVED_1">SEPARATE REPORT OF EACH SPECIES OBSERVED.</h3>

<p>At North Ronaldshay, an Owl&mdash;species unknown, but probably
the Short-eared Owl, <i>Asio acciptrinus</i>&mdash;was seen on Nov. 3rd,
flying south, at 10 a.m.; and at Dunnet Head a Horned Owl, also
probably of the same species, struck three times, but got away.
This was at 6 p.m.</p>

<p>From Pentland Skerries we have all the records of hawks.
Two early records (July 7th and 14th) may refer to autumn
migration or not. Thus, "a black hawk" was seen on July 7th
at 3 p.m., and on the 14th another of the same at 7 p.m. On
Sept. 17th one hawk struck at 11.30 p.m. The species is probably,
the Sparrowhawk, <i>Accipter nisus</i>.</p>

<p>Accounts forwarded by other correspondents, however, show
that Hobbies (<i>Falco subbuteo</i>, Linn.), visited the Lewis in some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">-163-</span>
numbers this year.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> At Sumburgli Head the appearance of
a White-tailed Eagle is recorded, but is only of local interest,
as these birds are known to breed near that station. That a
migration, however, does take place amongst Eagles, and mostly
of this species, is undoubted. Mr. D. Dewar, an experienced
ornithologist, writes me:&mdash;"Every winter, for this longtime back,
when we have a strong east wind in November, Eagles and Rough-legged
Buzzards appear over Loch Tay. In November, this year,
I saw four Eagles together, all White-tailed, and three Rough-legged
Buzzards along with them."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> I have referred more fully to this in my "Report on Scottish Ornithology" for
the Nat. Hist. Soc. of Glasgow for 1879-80.&mdash;<i>J. A. H.-B</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Swift</span>, <i>Cypselus apus</i>.&mdash;Only one at Sumburgh Head on
May 25th, doubtless on the spring migration. Two were seen at
10 a.m., wind light S.W., breeze and haze. "Swifts, however, do
not breed in Shetland" (<i>vide</i> Saxby's 'Birds of Shetland,' p. 147).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swallow</span>, <i>Hirundo rustica</i>.&mdash;I have returns from four stations,
Sumburgh Head, Auskerry, Tarbet Ness, and Isle of May. At
the northernmost station (Sumburgh Head) "a number were seen
flying about," at 11 am., wind at W.S.W., fresh and hazy. But
this record was on June 12th, so probably refers to the spring
migration. Their earliest appearance noted is August 21st, when
four struck at Auskerry at 1 a.m., wind S.E., strong with fog; the
latest Oct. 27th, when two were killed at Tarbet Ness at 7.10 p.m.,
wind N.W., light with fog. This shows migration between Aug.
21st and Oct. 27th. A "rush" appears to have taken place at
the Isle of May on Sept. 19th, at 2 a.m., wind light E. with fog,
when a flock of young birds was seen and four of them were
wounded against the glass. Swallows migrate in August and
September with an E. to S.E. wind, light to strong. In October
my only record at Tarbet Ness gives wind N.W., light with fog.
When the wind has been N.W., S.E. or E. there has been fog;
when, in summer, at Sumburgh Head, W.S.W., there has been
haze and rain. The last Swallow was seen in Berwickshire by
Mr. J. Hardy on the 30th Sept. 1879.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span>, <i>Hirundo urbica</i>.&mdash;From Pentland Skerries one record
in which this species is distinguished from the Swallow. On
August 25th one struck at 2.30 p.m. during a light W. wind
with haze. The last was seen in Berwickshire by Mr. J. Hardy
on the 3rd October, 1879.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">-164-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wren</span>, <i>Troglodytes europ&aelig;us</i>.&mdash;At North Ronaldshay five seen
during the daytime on Nov. 21st, fresh breeze (direction not
noted) with haze. Reported as usually appearing in large
numbers at Auskerry, but the above-mentioned were the only
ones seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldcrest</span>, <i>Regulus cristatus</i>.&mdash;The almost total absence of
this species is specially remarked at the Isle of May. Usually they
are abundant. These birds were decidedly scarce in Scotland
throughout the summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>, <i>Erythaca rubecula</i>.&mdash;Only two records of this species
on the east coast. At Tarbet Ness one was killed on August 6th
at 10 p.m., wind light E. breeze, fog and rain; and at Inch Keith
one struck on August 10th at 11.30 p.m., in similar weather, but
with wind light W.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheatear</span>, <i>Saxicola &#339;nanthe</i>.&mdash;The most northerly station
of the two recorded is Pentland Skerries, and to the south the
Bell Rock. Between Sept. 7th&mdash;when great numbers struck and
were lost at the latter station, and birds continued passing or
flying round lantern between midnight and dawn, wind S.E. and
variable, fog and haze&mdash;and Sept. 17th, Wheatears or "Stonechats"
were on passage. If any rush took place it was between
Sept. 7th and 11th, on which latter day fourteen were seen and
two killed. Winds veered from S. and S.E. on. Sept. 9th and 7th,
to W. and S.W. on the 11th, 13th and 17th. All the birds passed
at night between 8 p.m. and dawn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Titmice.</span>&mdash;At only one station were Titmice observed on our
east coast, <i>viz.</i>, at the Isle of May, were some were seen on
Sept. 15th at 10 a.m., wind light W. with haze. From Auskerry,
however, there is the general report that they are in most years
abundant there, though none have been seen this season.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Song Thrush</span>, <i>Tardus musicus</i>.&mdash;Recorded from a number of
stations from North Ronaldshay in the north to Auskerry, Pentland
Skerries, Dunnet Head, Noss Head, Girdleness, and Bell
Rock in the south. The greatest numbers noted were at Pentland
Skerries, but great numbers also were noted at North
Ronaldshay and the Bell Rock, where many "struck and were
lost." Their earliest appearance recorded is on Sept. 16th, when
four struck at Noss Head between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m., wind S.,
moderate with haze. The latest date is Oct. 25th, when numbers,
along with Blackbirds, struck at North Ronaldshay. The time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">-165-</span>
thus occupied was from Sept. 16th to Oct. 25th. A rush took
place during October, and the greatest rush, perhaps, between
Oct. 14th and 25th. At North Ronaldshay, on Oct. 1st, numbers
struck, along with Blackbirds, and were flying about all night.
Others seen at Girdleness, the Bell Rock, at Pentland Skerries, and
Dunnet Head. Thrushes migrated when the wind was between
E. through S.E., S.S.W. to N.W., but principally when southerly.
Fog, haze, and rain on all the dates given. Time of migration,
after dark and before dawn at all dates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackbird</span>, <i>Turdus merula</i>.&mdash;Appeared at North Ronaldshay
and the Bell Rock between Oct. 1st and Nov. 25th. A rush during
this time recorded on three dates:&mdash;Oct. 1st, "Numbers flying
about all night," at North Ronaldshay, wind S.E., strong, "along
with Thrushes." Oct. 14th, four (two males and two females)
killed; number flying about between 8 a.m. and dawn; wind
N.E., fresh, with haze and rain. Nov. 25th, numbers, along with
Thrushes, flying about all night; wind light E. breeze, haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ring Ouzel</span> (or "Mountain Blackbird"), <i>Turdus torquatus</i>.&mdash;Reported
from Sumburgh Head only, where one struck at 4 a.m.;
wind light N. at 5 a.m., S.W. gale at 4 p.m.; weather clear. A
number of the same species were seen in the country about the
same time, and supposed to be young birds. At Auskerry, where
they generally pass in large numbers, none were observed.</p>

<p>Besides the above, "large Thrushes," probably Fieldfares,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
passed or were caught at Auskerry, in October; four on the 15th
between 1 and 4 a.m., wind light N., clear; six on the 16th between
2 and 4 a.m., wind S.S.W., strong, haze; and two on the 22nd at
3 a.m., wind strong S.W., and haze. Large numbers struck the
lantern at the Bell Rock, and were lost in the sea between midnight
and dawn on Sept. 7th, and again at the same station on
Oct. 14th, between 3 a.m. and dawn. These were mixed in flocks
of Blackbirds, Thrushes, and "various" other species.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Afterwards identified as such by the head, wings and tail
sent in later communication.</p>

</div>

<p>The great scarcity of Thrushes in Scotland all summer was
caused by the severe winter of 1878-79 and late spring of 1879,
a consequent "crowding down" upon lower latitudes taking place
during that breeding season. I have referred very fully to this in
my first Report on Scottish Ornithology for the Natural History
Society of Glasgow for 1878-79 (now in MS., ready for press),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">-166-</span>
read Sept. 30th, 1879. This scarcity is still felt. In the birch-woods
of the west coast I saw small flocks on Oct. 28th, 1879.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rook</span>, <i>Corvus frugilegus</i>.&mdash;At Sumburgh Head numbers were
seen about 9 am on Nov. 2nd, wind N.N.W., strong to fresh, with
sleet and snow showers. "Rooks do not breed in Shetland, but
are often seen in the spring time, but very seldom in the fall,
crossing, as is supposed, between Norway and Scotland." At
Dunnet Head about 100 Rooks, mostly young birds, were seen
at 12 noon, with fresh breeze from S.E. to S.W.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starling</span>, <i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>.&mdash;Noted at only two stations. At
Pentland Skerries on October 19th six struck between 6 p.m. and
4 a.m., wind S.W. and rain; on the 26th one at 8 p.m., wind W.,
and clear; and on Nov. 20th two at 6 a.m., wind S.W., strong and
haze. At Dunnet Head, on Oct. 20th, seven struck and four were
killed at night, wind N.W. and N.E., haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Siskin</span>, <i>Carduelis spinus</i>.&mdash;At Inch Keith three young birds
struck at 1 a.m. on Sept. 16th, wind light W., fog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lark</span>, <i>Alauda arvensis</i>.&mdash;Pretty generally recorded, but scarcer
than usual; the northernmost station Pentland Skerries. They
are also noted at Tarbet Ness and Girdleness. The most counted
was thirty-six at Pentland Skerries between 5 p.m. and 4 a.m. on
October 13th-14th, and the next largest number was sixteen, on
Sept. 15th, between 8 and 10 p.m. Their earliest appearance
was on August 16th, when four struck at midnight at Tarbet
Ness, wind light S.E. and haze; the latest Nov. 19th, when nine
struck (four killed) at the same station at 8.10 p.m., wind S.W.,
light and haze. The time occupied is thus between August 16th
and Nov. 19th. A rush took place between Oct. 13th and 14th,
or say about the middle of October, and again about November
19th at Pentland Skerries, Tarbet Ness, and Girdleness.</p>

<p>Larks migrated or came most under notice in S.W. winds, but
also in S.E., N.E. (as at Pentland Skerries, when thirty-six were
seen), and W. Our data from the Scotch coasts are too limited
this year to admit of conclusions, unaided by the English returns.
Haze and fog are recorded on all the days noticed. All records
give hours of passing at night from 6 p.m. in October, and from
8 10 p.m. in November till 4 or 5 a.m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodpecker</span>, <i>Picus (major?)</i>.&mdash;At Inch Keith two struck and
an adult bird was killed at 9 p.m. on Sept. 15th, wind W., light
breeze and fog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">-167-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lapwing</span>, <i>Vanellus cristatus</i>.&mdash;Reported to have left the
vicinity of Hoy Sound in the third week of September. At
Auskerry thirty or forty were seen about 3 p.m. on Sept. 11th, wind
light W. and haze, and at Tarbet Ness a large flock was seen at
11 a.m., when the wind was N.W., light and haze on Oct. 12th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plover</span>, <i>Charadrius pluvialis</i>.&mdash;At Pentland Skerries a flock
was seen at 1.15 a.m. on Sept. 3rd, wind S.W., almost calm, with
fog, and another flock at 2 p.m. on Dec. 7th, wind N.W. and clear.
These represent earliest and latest dates. At Dunnet Head about
160 Plovers passed with S.E. wind and rain. At Tarbet Ness a
large flock seen at 4 p.m., wind N.W., fresh and haze on Oct. 12th.
Plovers remained unusually late on the high hills of Perthshire
this autumn. On Oct. 15th I saw three on the hills around
Glen Queich, and two flocks on the 16th. On the 14th was a
snowstorm and ice a quarter of an inch in thickness on hill
puddles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heron</span>, <i>Ardea cinerea</i>.&mdash;At Girdleness on October 23rd two
Herons were seen at 3.30 p.m., wind S.W., clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curlew</span>, <i>Numenius arquata</i>.&mdash;Only three records, one of which
no doubt refers to local migration or to late spring or summer.
On June 29th a flock was seen at Pentland Skerries at 7.40 p.m.
At Sumburgh Head, on July 30th, "a number crying very loud"
were heard about 11 a.m., wind W.S.W. (gale on Aug. 1st), with
haze and rain. At Pentland Skerries, on Dec. 11th, a flock was
noted at 7.40 p.m. during light W. wind and clear. Did the migration
last from July 30th to Dec. 11th? Curlews appear to migrate
from early dawn to dusk, as far as records show. These birds were
nearly a month late in arriving on our coast in Stirlingshire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandpiper</span> (sp.?).&mdash;At Pentland Skerries three struck and
were killed; wind strong S.W. and haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodcock</span>, <i>Scolopax rusticola</i>.&mdash;The most northerly station
was North Ronaldshay. Thence southward, but nowhere in large
numbers, seen or struck at Auskerry, Pentland Skerries, Dunnet
Head, Tarbet Ness, Girdleness, and Isle of May. The largest
number seen at any station at the same time being five at Tarbet
Ness on December 3rd. A single bird is noted at Dunnet Head
as early as Sept. 17th. None again till Oct. 15th, when one was
killed at North Ronaldshay at 9 p.m., wind N.E., moderate, with
sleet. The latest recorded was Dec. 3rd, when, as related above,
five were seen at Tarbet Ness at 11.30 a.m., wind strong W., with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">-168-</span>
snow. The length of time occupied in migration was between
Sept. 17th and Dec. 3rd. "Rushes" of migrants took place
between Oct. 15th and 21st, but the reports are very meagre,
being in most cases instanced by single birds striking at North
Ronaldshay, Auskerry, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May. Again
a rush between Nov. 11th and 19th at North Ronaldshay and
Girdleness; and again between Dec. 1st and 3rd at North Ronaldshay
and Tarbet Ness. In two cases only have more than single
birds been recorded. The migration took place principally when
the wind was between S. and W.; but I have records of their
flights also in strong N. wind with snow, on Dec. 1st, at Tarbet
Ness; in N.E., moderate breeze with sleet, on Oct. 15th at North
Ronaldshay; and again, with an E. light breeze and clear, on
Dec. 21st, at the same station. When the wind has been S.W. or
W., there has been fog or haze; when S., rain, as in November, on
the 14th and 15th. Woodcocks appear to migrate principally at
night, and are observed during the hours between evening dusk
and morning grey, or, in other words, between 7.30 p.m. and
5 a.m. Exceptions occur, as at 11 a.m. at North Ronaldshay
11.30 a.m. at Tarbet Ness, 2 p.m. at North Ronaldshay, and 3.30
p.m. at Girdleness; these last being all in daylight. A flight
came inland in Stirlingshire about Nov. 22nd, on which day a
party of five guns, of which party I was one, killed eighteen in
Torwood Covers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snipe</span>, <i>Gallinago scolopacina</i>.&mdash;At the Isle of May one was
seen at 10 a.m. on August 6th, with light S.E. wind, fog and rain.
Snipe scarce or much scattered, owing to wet season. Entirely
disappeared from inland localities when the hard frost of beginning
of December set in, and few returned all winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Water Rail</span>, <i>Rallus aquaticus</i>.&mdash;One record at Girdleness;
on August 17th, one was seen at 8 p.m., wind E. with rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grey Geese.</span>&mdash;At Dunnet Head, on Sept. 3rd, thirteen Grey
Geese were seen "going north" at 3 p.m., wind S.E., fresh, haze
and rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bernacle Goose</span>, <i>Bernicla brenta</i>.&mdash;At Dunnet Head a mixed
flock of old and young (twenty-five) seen going W. on Sept. 7th,
and five more on the 14th, during the day, wind light W. Fog on
the 7th; clear on the 14th. <i>Anatid&aelig;</i> were a month earlier in
appearing on Loch Tay in the autumn of 1879. Geese were
reported as unusually abundant from many localities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">-169-</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swans.</span>&mdash;Three Swans seen at North Ronaldshay flying south
at 2.30 p.m., with W.N.W. fresh wind and clear, and again at
same place at 9.30 a.m., on Nov. 27th, swimming on the water;
wind strong N.E., and clear. At Pentland Skerries eight were
seen at 2 p.m. on Oct. 26th; wind light W. and clear. At Dunnet
Head three old and one young seen going S.W., at 1 p.m., breeze
light, on Sept 14th; and three old birds again on Sept. 22nd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ducks.</span>&mdash;At Tarbet Ness a large flock of ducks passed inland
at 10 a.m., with a N. gale and snow, on Nov. 12th. At Girdleness,
two ducks seen at 4.40 a.m., wind S.W., and haze, on
Oct. 16th. At Tarbet Ness a large flock seen at 9.15 a.m., wind
W., strong and snow, on Dec. 5th. At Dunnet Head seven ducks
(Widgeon) stayed on the lake three days from Oct. 25th; arrived
with W. to N.W. breeze and cloudy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guillemot</span>, <i>Uria troile</i>.&mdash;At Pentland Skerries a flock seen
on June 25th, at 7.15 p.m.; wind E.N.E., and light haze. (Compare
with notes on W. coast at Cape Wrath and elsewhere.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puffin</span>, <i>Mormon fratercula</i>.&mdash;At North Unst innumerable
Puffins seen on evening of April 24th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Skua</span> (or "Bonxie"), <i>Stercorarius catarrhactes</i>.&mdash;At
North Unst, usually appear about middle of April. "We do not
see more than six or eight in a season."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petrel</span>, <i>Thalassidroma pelagica</i>.&mdash;Seen at North Unst in
August, and at Dunnet Head on Oct. 10th, wind strong W., and
haze, at 11 p.m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tern</span>, <i>Sterna</i>.&mdash;Only one record. One struck at Pentland
Skerries at 8.30 p.m. on Sept. 8th; wind strong S., and fog.</p>

<p>Terns always appear upon our Stirlingshire coast the end of
August and beginning of September, remaining usually about a
fortnight to three weeks.</p>

<p>The unusual scarcity of migrants is very generally reported
upon at almost all the east coast stations. The remarks of the
reporters, comparing the observations with former years, generally
show this to be the case. Thus, commencing with our most
northerly station. North Unst, I find it stated that, in most
seasons, "Land birds, as Snow Buntings, Stonechats, and
Starlings, strike the lantern." It is also stated that&mdash;"Until
the last three years, large flocks of Iceland Gulls were seen
during the month of April, going N.W. A few returned this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">-170-</span>
way." They are seen, however, every year in some numbers in
October. At Sumburgh Head, Mr. Anderson says, "In twenty-one
years I have not seen so few birds strike the lantern"; and
Mr. Tulloch, writing from North Ronaldshay, says, "We have
had so much of N.W. winds here this fall, that I think the birds
have been kept more towards the south." Similar complaints of
scarcity of migrants reach me from Auskerry, Hoy Sound (High),
Holborn Head, Ness Head, and Isle of May; and an entire
<i>absence</i> of all birds&mdash;"since the schedules came to hand"&mdash;is
reported at several of these stations. The reason assigned by
Mr. Tulloch is no doubt the correct one. From other stations
local influences probably have more to do with the scarcity, as,
for instance, the unfavourable positions of the lanterns. Thus,
Cromarty is "situated on the point of the town of Cromarty, and
almost among the houses." During seventeen years that the
present principal light-keeper has been there, he does not think
that more than a dozen birds have struck the glass. Altogether,
few of our Scottish stations are situated in as favourable positions
for observation as the lightships of the English coast. Perhaps
the Bell Rock and Isle of May are the most favourable in the
south, and the Pentland Skerries and some of the Orkney and
Shetland stations in the north.</p>

<p>Besides the records under the various species which have been
identified, there are many records of birds striking or passing,
which were not identified. It is from a comparison of these and
the other records that I arrive at the conclusion that the above
stations are the most favoured. Thus, large numbers of birds
struck the lantern of Bell Rock, and were lost between midnight
and dawn on Oct. 7th, and again on the 14th, between 3 a.m. and
dawn; on both occasions in foggy, hazy, or rainy weather, &amp;c., as
is almost invariably the case. I have not been able to trace from
actual data, except in a few cases, the direction of the flight of
the migrants, as such has not, as a rule, been noted by the
reporters. It would be an advantage to have this done next
season, under the column in the schedule for "General Observations."
The species which have appeared in greatest numbers
are Thrushes and Blackbirds, Larks, Wheatears, and Swallows;
whilst Hooded Crows&mdash;noted as most numerous on the English
east coast&mdash;are absent from all the Scottish returns, and Rooks
occur only in one very far north instance, <i>viz.</i>, at North Unst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">-171-</span></p>

<p>The line of flight of the <i>Anatid&aelig;</i> is generally from N. to S.,
as explained further on by Mr. Cordeaux. I may mention here
that this holds generally also on the west coast of Scotland, but
that the lines of flight of the <i>Insessores</i> are influenced by local
causes, and configuration and trend of the west coast. Thus the
direction, according to previous experience, is often from N.W.
to S.E. When migrating over or near land the lines of flight
follow the great valleys and then the coast-lines, often cutting off
promontories, as at the Ross of Mull. These are probably birds
having a starting-point more to the N.W.,&mdash;the Hebrides, Iceland,
and North America,&mdash;and others which in their migrations from
east to west overshoot the land and "hark back"; but we will
speak more of this in our remarks under "West Coast." Land
birds have passed at all hours of the day and night, flying
generally low, and in almost all kinds of weather. The <i>Anatid&aelig;</i>,
as a rule, fly much higher, and consequently are only seen, or
almost only, in clear weather.</p>

<p>Almost all records of birds caught or killed, or striking at
the lanterns, are noted on dark or cloudy nights, with fog, haze
or rain, or snow and sleet. The isolated stations, such as the
Bell Rock, are most deadly; many are stunned and killed, and
blown into the sea, at such localities. Birds on such nights often
remain around the lights all night or rest on the window-sills of
the tower and the balconies, or endeavour to obtain entrance to
the tower. Whenever dawn appears they resume their flight
towards the nearest land.</p>

<p>A great northward rush appears to have taken place at Bell
Rock lighthouse between the 2nd and 11th of March, 1880, as
noted in the duplicate schedule by Mr. James Jack, lately received
by me. On the 2nd March great numbers of birds were seen
flying about the lantern, apparently of various species, of which
Blackbirds, Thrushes, and Mavises were recognised; wind S.,
light breeze, heavy sleet; sexes unidentified; a great number
continued to strike hard on lantern all night from 10 p.m., and
rebounding off, fell into the sea. On the 9th, great numbers,
including Lapwings, Thrushes, Mavises, "Snowflecks," Rooks and
"Sea-piets," from 5 a.m. till good daylight, when all disappeared
in the fog; observer could not say in which direction they flew;
wind S.E., light breeze, fog, and rain. This has been the largest
migration seen this year; very large numbers of each species
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">-172-</span>
seen. On the 11th March great numbers of Lapwings, Curlews,
Blackbirds, and "Sea-piets," from 12 midnight till first streak of
day, when all disappeared; cannot say in which direction; wind
N.E., light breeze, and haze. A few struck lantern-lights and
flew off again; sexes not made out. A perceptible increase in
our birds at inland localities took place about this time, and
notes on migration taken at various inland localities corroborate
the rush at coast stations. Curlews were seen passing inland on
March 6th for first time. Great Tits much increased in numbers,
as also Chaffinches, Starlings, Thrushes, Blackbirds, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Great credit is due to the observers of the various stations for
the careful manner in which, as a rule, the returns have been
made out. Taking them altogether the reports show truthful,
accurate, and painstaking observation. Excluding the <i>Anatid&aelig;</i>,
Swans, Geese and Ducks, notes have been taken of about thirty-two
different species.</p>

<p>Of <i>Raptores</i> two only are mentioned, the Sparrowhawk and the
Short-eared Owl. Of the former one visited the Inner Dowsing on
Oct. 1st, at 8 p.m. At the Gull-stream on Sept. 19th one alighted
on deck and was caught. At the South-sand Head on Sept. 23rd
a very large Sparrowhawk stopped to rest on the rail, going W. At
the same station on Oct. 2nd another settled on the lantern, also
leaving for the west. These may have been hawks in passage, or
pirates beating in the track of small migrants. The Short-eared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">-174-</span>
Owl occurs only at Teesmouth; on Sept. 29th one passed at daybreak,
one on Oct. 1st at 7 a.m., and another on the 16th at 3 p.m.</p>

<p>I saw the first Short-eared Owl on the Lincolnshire coast on
Oct. 30th. Twelve were seen at Spurn the same morning. It
thus appears that the migration of this species has extended just
over a month, from Sept. 29th to Oct. 30th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flycatcher</span>, <i>Muscicapa grisola</i>.&mdash;At the Galloper on Sept.
13th, from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., hazy, 200 to 300 birds, mostly Flycatchers;
twenty killed against glass of lantern. At the Kentish
Knock on Sept. 18th two dozen Flycatchers through night around
lantern, rain, going S.W. at daylight; none killed. At the Nore,
Aug. 22nd, at sunrise, mixed with Larks, and again on Sept. 7th,
same hour, without Larks. At the Gull-stream, on Sept. 17th, at
3.20 a.m., E., thick rain, large quantities of Flycatchers; lantern
surrounded by birds. On Oct. 11th-12th, 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., N.N.E.,
rain, large numbers of Larks, Starlings and Flycatchers in vicinity
of light; many struck and went overboard. Time of migration
extending over fifty-two days.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> I find the following reference to this species in my note-book:&mdash;"Did not

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Song Thrush, Redwing, Fieldfare, Blackbird</span>, and <span class="smcap">Ring
Ouzel</span>.&mdash;With the exception of the last, which is reported from
Heligoland, the <i>Turdid&aelig;</i> are noticed at fourteen stations extending
over the whole coast-line. At the Longstone, on Sept. 11th, four
Redwings killed at 3 a.m., gloomy and thick; on Oct. 30th and 31st
Thrushes, Blackbirds and Redwings passed, wind E. and N. At
the Farn Islands, Oct. 14th, Redwings, 9 a.m.; 15th, Thrushes and
Blackbirds, N.N.E. half a gale; 22nd, several Blackbirds; 30th,
same, and flocks of Redwings all day, E.; Nov. 20th, Fieldfares
all day, E. strong; 22nd, same; Dec. 5th, 3 p.m., snow. Blackbirds
and Thrushes. At Teesmouth on Dec. 1st, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.,
snow. Redwings, Thrushes and Fieldfares, going from N. to S.W.;
Dec. 2nd, a few Redwings. At Teesmouth lighthouse on Oct. 1st,
at daylight, forty to fifty Thrushes, and twenty to thirty at 9 a.m.
on the 7th; on Dec. 4th, at 6 a.m., one Blackbird struck the glass
and was killed. At Spurn on Dec. 2nd, 9 a.m., large numbers of
Thrushes. At the Outer Dowsing, Sept. 24th, four Blackbirds; on
the 29th, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., six Thrushes. At the Leman and Ower
on Dec. 16th, Thrushes in company with Larks and Starlings all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">-175-</span>
through the night. At Cromer on Oct. 24th three Thrushes struck
the lantern during the night; on the 30th four, and on Nov. 16th
five others. At the Newarp, Nov. 28th, 9 a.m., six Blackbirds passed.
At the Kentish Knock, Nov. 18th, one Thrush killed. At the Nore,
Nov. 7th, four Blackbirds, going W.S.W.; Nov. 3rd, Fieldfares.
At the North Foreland, Nov. 21st, 1 a.m., E.S.E., snow, one Blackbird
killed. At the Gull-stream, Nov. 21st, cloudy and showers of
snow, Starlings, Blackbirds, and Thrushes in the vicinity of light
from 1 to 4 a.m.; six Starlings, four Thrushes, and one Blackbird
killed. At the South-sand Head, Oct. 12th, dense fog, many
Thrushes; several killed. General line of migration, with few
exceptions, E. to W., carried on both by day and night; a considerable
proportion, however, appear to arrive from daybreak to
10 a.m. Migration of Thrush extending over seventy-seven days,
from Oct. 1st at Teesmouth to Dec. 16th at the Leman and Ower;
of Redwing, sixty-five days, from Sept. 11th at the Longstone to
Dec. 2nd at Teesmouth; of Fieldfare, twenty-eight days, from
Nov. 3rd at the Nore to Dec. 1st at Teesmouth;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of Blackbird,
seventy-two days, from Sept. 24th at the Outer Dowsing to Dec. 5th
at Farn Islands.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> On Oct. 29th, S.E. and E., <i>Tardus iliacus</i> crossed
Heligoland in large numbers, "thousands and thousands" passing
on overhead; the same day, <i>T. torquatus</i>, "a few"; <i>T. merula</i> and
<i>T. musicus</i>, "limited numbers"; "<i>T. iliacus</i> descending from
invisible heights down to about one hundred feet above island,&mdash;three
hundred feet above the sea,&mdash;then all of them passing on;
when atmosphere got clear again, in afternoon, passage ceased."
Again on the night of the 30th, N.N.E., "enormous number of
<i>Turdid&aelig;</i> passing overhead."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Mr. W. Eagle Clarke reports that on the 24th of January last large numbers
of Fieldfares were seen between Easington and Kilnsea, near Spurn Point, and as they
were the first seen in the neighbourhood this season they were no doubt immigrants,
more particularly as the locality in which they were seen is one where they are only
observed during or immediately after arrival. Large flocks appeared also in North-East
Lincolnshire during the last fortnight in January, so far as my own observations
go, composed entirely of old birds. Mr. G&auml;tke also writes, "All January through,
night from 10th to 11th, great many from the east; 21st to 24th, the same."&mdash;<i>J. C.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Numbers of fine old cock Blackbirds arrived at Spurn during the latter part of
January, and early in February at the same time with the Fieldfares.&mdash;<i>J. C.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Redbreast, Whitethroat, Wren.</span>&mdash;The same notes in the
reports applying generally to the three species, it is not necessary
to treat them separately. At Coquet Island, on Sept. 13th, 11 p.m.,
two Redbreasts struck glass, not killed. At Hunstanton, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">-176-</span>
Oct. 13th, 1 p.m., fog, a Wren and Redbreast seen. At Cromer,
May 23rd, 1 a.m., a great many Wrens; two killed, also one Redbreast;
May 27th, 11 p.m., Wrens and Whitethroats, five killed
(these last notes are referable to the spring migration); Sept. 12th,
Wrens and three Redbreasts strike glass. At Spurn this autumn
the Common Wren did not appear before the middle of December;
they usually arrive about the end of October.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Redbreasts were
very numerous at Spurn on Oct. 30th, wind blowing very fresh
from N.E. None reported from Heligoland, but a great many
Accentor modularis on Oct. 29th, wind S.E. and E.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> A friend, the owner of several steam-tugs, informs me that he has frequently
known the Common Wren to come on board his vessels when far from land on the
North Sea.&mdash;<i>J. C.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Golden-crested Wren.</span>&mdash;Most exceptionally scarce; only one
mentioned, at the Cockle, on Oct. 16th, at 3 p.m., wind N.N.E.,
when one came on board and was caught. Three were seen in a
garden near Spurn on Oct. 27th and 28th; none, so far as I am
aware, on any part of the Lincolnshire and Durham coasts, neither
are they mentioned in the Heligoland report.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Titmice.</span>&mdash;At the Gull-stream, Sept. 17th, 3.20 a.m., thick,
rain, E., several Titmice seen round lantern amongst the Flycatchers.
Mr. G&auml;tke remarks, "There have been no Parus major
all this autumn, and we have actually seen only one bird"; early
in October, "daily some <i>Parus ater</i>, that come here rarely but
when there is an appearance of easterly winds."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheatear.</span>&mdash;At Hunstanton, May 24th, 11 p.m. to 2 a.m., drizzly
rain, forty-one small birds killed, amongst them three Wheatears.
At Cromer, Aug. 16th, 1 a.m., several Wheatears; four killed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Titlark</span>, <i>Anthus sp.?</i>&mdash;At Spurn, May 25th, 1 a.m., rain,
several Titlarks killed (referable to the spring migration), At
the South-sand Head, Oct. 12th, 3 a.m., N.E., dense fog, Titlarks,
amongst thousands of other birds, around and passing lantern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shore Lark</span>, <i>Otocorys alpestris</i>.&mdash;On Dec. 19th two were shot,
from a small flock on the Humber side of Spurn Point; these
were received in the flesh on the 22nd by Mr. W. Eagle Clarke, of
Leeds.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> At Heligoland, on Oct. 1st, "some flights"; 5th, "some
score"; 8th, "a great many"; 10th, "many flights"; on the 24th
likewise, and again on the 29th, "many."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Mr. Clarke subsequently informed me that on March 18th, this year, he saw a
flock of about twenty Shore Larks at Spurn, and that during the past winter thirty-three
have been shot there, in the proportion of two males to one female.&mdash;<i>J. C.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">-177-</span></p>

<p><a id="Sky_Lark"></a><span class="smcap">Sky Lark</span>, <i>Alauda arvensis</i>.&mdash;None reported north of the
Humber, and a negative return from Heligoland. South of the
Humber, from every station making returns, and showing a
gradual increase towards the more southern stations, where they
crossed in immense numbers. Earliest date of passage, July 24th,
at the Goodwin, 10 a.m., ninety to a hundred flying N.W. to the
nearest land, and again at the same station on Aug. 4th. After
this no further notice till Sept. 17th, when the regular and normal
migration of this species appears to have set in and continued
without intermission till Dec. 27th. Leaving out the two earliest
dates as exceptional, we shall find that the immigration of the
Larks to our east coast was continued over 102 days. During
October, November and December (first fortnight) they crossed
continually, passing from E. to W., also from points S. of E.
to others N. of W., over the narrowest part of the North Sea,
as is shown in the returns of the most southern lightships&mdash;Galloper,
Kentish Knock, Nore, North Foreland, Goodwin, Gull-stream,
East Side, and South-sand Head; time, any hour of the
day or night; direction of wind, variable. It would be quite
impossible in a limited space to give anything like a detailed
statement of the immigration of Larks, so a few extracts from my
summary of the reports must suffice. There was a "great rush"
of Larks and other species between Oct. 12th and 23rd. On the
16th October more birds appear to have crossed than on any day
during the autumn. There was again a "final rush" of the laggards
just preceding and during the outbreak of severe weather early in
December. At the Newarp, Sept. 29th to Oct. 27th, on fourteen
days, going W., no particular hour, some striking lantern at night.
At the Cockle, Sept. 28th to Oct. 17th, as a rule, very early in the
morning (4.30 to 9.20 a.m.), on foggy, thick nights stopping to
hover round lantern, some strike and are killed; Oct. 9th to 16th,
"great rush." At the Corton, Oct. 22nd and 23rd, flocks passing
all day to N.W.; Nov. 11th, many hundreds during day; and again
on Dec. 25th, all day from N.E. to S.W., Ducks and Larks;
Dec. 27th, hundreds of Larks during afternoon. At the Shipwash,
from Oct. 9th to 16th; all day on 15th and 16th. At the Galloper,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
from Oct. 8th to 24th, Larks, Starlings and Chaffinches, generally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">-178-</span>
during night; between these dates 135 of these species killed
against lantern. At the Kentish Knock, Oct. 23rd, N.W., hazy,
Larks and Chaffinches through night, "in clouds," sixty picked up
on deck, and probably double this number falling overboard;
Dec. 1st, from noon to 2.30 p.m., thick snow falling, Larks, Curlews,
Starlings, Ducks, Chaffinches and Linnets, too numerous to mention;
they came in clouds from N.E. to W.S.W. At the Nore,
Aug. 4th to Dec. 6th and 7th, on forty-four days; on Dec. 6th and
7th, by hundreds all day, often mixed with Starlings, Linnets and
Sparrows. At the North Foreland, on Sept. 17th, a few; Oct. 16th,
midnight, misty, fourteen Larks and ten Starlings; 17th, between
3 and 4 a.m., ten Larks and nine Starlings struck. At the Goodwin,
Sept. 17th to Dec. 7th, on nineteen days, going W. or N.W. or
W.N.W.; Oct. 13th and 15th, in shoals throughout night; 13th to
22nd, "great rush." At the Gull-stream, Oct. 16th to 22nd, "great
rush," flocks two hundred yards apart, passing westward. At
the East-side, Oct. 9th to Dec. 12th, on seven days, E. to W.; on
Sept. 23rd, going N. to S., with a N.E. wind blowing. At the South-sand
Head, Oct. 12th, 3 a.m., dense fog, "great rush," thousands of
Larks and other birds, many killed; Dec. 1st, 3 p.m., dense fog
and snow, "final rush," Larks, Starlings, and fifty Curlews; twelve
Starlings caught on board, but no Larks. Mr. J. H. Gurney, jun.,
writing from Lowestoft, says, "On Wednesday (Oct. 22nd), the
arrival of Larks here was regular throughout the day." On
Oct. 29th, at Spurn Point, Mr. W. Eagle Clarke, of Leeds, says,
"Sky Larks arriving and passing south in thousands the whole
day." Immense numbers also arrived on the Lincolnshire coast
in the last fortnight of October. (At Heligoland, Oct. 29th, S.E.,
and E., "<i>Alauda arboreus</i>, many.")</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Birds passing this station were all passing to E. or E.S.E. or S.E. in October.
On Nov. 24th great numbers of Larks and Starlings were observed passing to N.N.E.
See general remarks at end of report.&mdash;<i>J. C.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Snow Bunting</span>, <i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>.&mdash;None at stations south
of the Humber. At the Longstone, Sept. 5th, 8.30 a.m., wind S., one
was seen on the rocks; my correspondent remarks, "Earliest date
I have ever seen a Snow Bunting on these islands (Farn Isles)."
At the Farn Islands, Oct. 3rd, 11.30 a.m., three Snow Buntings
flying N.W.; Oct. 25th, afternoon, in flocks flying W. At Teesmouth,
Nov. 7th to Dec. 20th, several flocks between these dates
flying N.W. At Spurn, Snow Buntings were first seen on the 28th.
October; and large flocks of from 400 to 500 in the Lincolnshire
marshes during the first week in November. At Heligoland on
Oct. 30th, N.N.E., "<i>Emberiza nivalis</i>, a great many," and on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">-179-</span>
the 31st, S.E., calm, overcast, "Snow Buntings and Finches."
Leaving out the Farn Island date as exceptional,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> we find the
regular migration of this species to have commenced on Oct. 25th
and finished Dec. 20th&mdash;fifty-seven days.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> In a note to Yarrell's 'British Birds' (vol. ii., p. 6, 4th ed.), Prof. Newton cites,
on my authority, the occurrence of a Snow Bunting on the Lincolnshire coast on
Sept. 16th, 1875, as perhaps the earliest date for England. The Farn Island bird
must now take precedence by eleven days.&mdash;<i>J. C.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaffinch</span>, <i>Fringilla c&#339;lebs</i>.&mdash;Has occurred at several stations,
and both north and south of the Humber. At the Longstone,
Sept. 28th and Oct. 1st, 6 a.m. till noon, S. strong, rain and mist,
flocks of Finches and other birds going W. At the Outer Dowsing,
Oct. 18th, at noon, going E. to W.; Oct. 24th, 7 p.m., overcast,
rain, thirty round lantern, two killed. At the Leman and Owers,
Oct. 7th, N.N.E., gloomy, mixed flocks of Larks, Chaffinches and
Starlings during day and night. At the Newarp, Sept. 26th to
Oct. 23rd, on several days. At the Cockle, odd birds, on three days,
strike lantern or come on board. At the Kentish Knock, Oct. 23rd
and Dec. 1st (see <a href="#Sky_Lark">Sky Lark</a>). At the Goodwin, Sept. 17th, 9 to
11 p.m., overcast, hazy, flying round lantern. Migration extending
from Sept. 17th to Dec. 1st&mdash;seventy-six days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Linnet</span>, <i>Linota cannabina</i>.&mdash;None registered north of the
Shipwash, off the Essex coast, where from Oct. 9th to 16th flocks
passed daily, all hours, going E. to W. At the Nore, Oct. 14th
to Nov. 12th, invariably mixed with Larks. At the Gull-stream,
Oct. 15th to 22nd, many flocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twite</span>, <i>Linota flavirostris</i>.&mdash;One station only, the Kentish
Knock, Oct. 24th, misty with rain, "Mountain Linnets," Larks and
Starlings through the night; sixty picked up on deck, as many
more went overboard. Nov. 8th, one caught on deck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tree Sparrow</span>, <i>Passer montanus</i>.&mdash;Flocks of Sparrows<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> were
noticed at several stations south of the Humber. At the Outer
Dowsing, on Sept. 29th, at noon, and Oct. 13th, 2 p.m., travelling
from E. to W. At the Kentish Knock, Oct. 22nd to Nov. 8th, going
from S.E. to N.W.; on Nov. 8th two came on board. At the
Nore, Oct. 27th and Nov. 15th, on latter day mixed with Larks.
At the Goodwin, Oct. 6th and 22nd, passing to W.N.W. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">-180-</span>
the Gull-stream, Oct 16th, large numbers of Sparrows and Linnets
going W.; also on the 24th, 3.30 p.m., flocks 200 yards apart.
At the East-side, Nov. 8th, 9 a.m., a flock going E. to W. At the
South-sand Head, Oct. 8th, "French Sparrows"; 16th, the same,
some settled on board. Time of migration Sept. 29th to Nov. 15th&mdash;forty-eight
days. During September and October Tree Sparrows
usually arrive in North-East Lincolnshire in flocks containing
many hundreds. This year has been quite an exceptional one,
and only a few stragglers have been seen. I suspect the persistence
of north-westerly winds in the autumn has driven these
and the great body of our immigrants much further southward
than is usual. The returns indeed show this to be the case.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> It is not improbable that in some of the returns the entries may refer to the
Common Sparrow. We know, however, that Passer montanus is such a constant
and regular migrant to our east coast in the autumn that in the majority of cases
it will refer to this species.&mdash;<i>J. C.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">House Sparrow</span>, <i>Passer domesticus</i>.&mdash;Only once mentioned, at
the Corton, Sept. 28th, 7.50 a.m., large flock going west, males
and females. As the female of the preceding is undistinguishable
from the male, this entry undoubtedly refers to the Common
Sparrow. We know that the House Sparrow is a migrant across
Heligoland,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and my own observations on the Lincolnshire coast
tend to the same conclusion.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> See a letter by Mr. G&auml;tke in 'The Times,' March 31st, 1877, on the "Migration
of Sparrows."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Starling</span>, <i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>.&mdash;Next to the Lark, the Starling
occupies the most prominent position in the reports. It is noticed
both north and south of the Humber at seventeen stations:&mdash;the
Longstone, Coquet Island, Teesmouth, Outer Dowsing, Inner
Dowsing, Leman and Ower, Cromer, Newarp, Cockle, Galloper,
Kentish Knock, Nore, North Foreland, Goodwin, Gull-stream,
East-side, and South-sand Head. Enormous numbers passed the
southern stations in October, November and December. Sometimes
in separate flocks, sometimes mixed with other birds. They
crossed at all hours of the day and night, and in all winds and
weather. Earliest recorded, Cromer, June 10th, 2 a.m., "quantity";
the Newarp, 7 a.m., on July 4th, going E. to W.; these were
young birds.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Leaving out the earliest dates as referring to the
migration of the young, we find that the regular immigration
on to our east coast commenced on Sept. 22nd, when four were
killed against the lantern of the Longstone at 3 a.m., to Dec. 16th
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">-181-</span>
at the Leman and Ower&mdash;eighty-six days; migration E. to W. The
Starling, like the Lark, appears to have a particular facility for
immolating itself against the lanterns. At the Leman and Ower
large nmnbers of Starlings, along with Larks and Chaffinches, were
taken in October; at the Galloper (see <a href="#Sky_Lark">Sky Lark</a>); also at the
North Foreland, and many other instances too numerous to
mention. At Heligoland this year there have been no young
Starlings during July; Mr. G&auml;tke says he may perhaps have seen
a hundred, and this is all.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> This bears out Mr. G&auml;tke's observation in a letter dated Heligoland, 1879,
when he says, "Hundreds of thousands of young Starlings from end of June to end
of July. Hundreds of thousands of old birds during October, November, and later;
young and old strictly divided in their migrations."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hooded Crow</span>, <i>Corvus cornix</i>; <span class="smcap">Rook</span>, <i>C. frugilegus</i>; <span class="smcap">Daw</span>,
<i>C. monedula</i>.&mdash;The migration of Rooks is not noted on the
English coast north of the Humber; south of this they were
noticed at nearly every station as either Rooks or "Black Crows,"
to distinguish them from the Hoodie or Grey Crow. Immense
numbers of both Rooks and Grey Crows crossed on Oct. 16th from
daylight to dark, travelling from E. to W. Noticeably at the Inner
Dowsing, on Oct. 16th, large number of Crowds, from N.E. to W.;
at Hunstanton, on the 17th, Hooded Crowds and Rooks all day; at
the Newarp, on the 16th; at the Cockle, the same day "height of
rush," Crows and Rooks, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., going W., and again on
the 22nd, 23rd and 24th, large numbers of Crows, Rooks, Starlings
and Larks, from daylight to dark, passing W.; again on Nov. 8th,
large flocks of Crows. At the Corton, on Oct. 16th and 22nd, continuous
flocks of Crows, Daws and Larks all day, E. to W., also
Nov. 8th and 11th and Dec. 27th. At the Shipwash, Oct. 15th and
16th, constant on 15th, till 12 a.m.; on 16th, 9 a.m. to 3.20 p.m.,
from S.S.E. to N.N.W. At the Goodwin, Oct. 15th to 21st, Crows
"in shoals." At the South-sand Head, Oct. 16th, Rooks, 9.30 a.m.,
going W.N.W. and N.W.; and seven other stations. In the
returns it is impossible in many cases, under the general entry of
"Crows," to separate the Hooded Crow from the Rook. It
appears, however, that immense numbers of the <i>Corvid&aelig;</i> crossed
the North Sea; Rooks at stations south of the Humber, and
Hooded Crows at both northern and southern stations from
Oct. 15th to Nov. 19th. Both Rooks and Hooded Crows appear
to have started simultaneously on Oct. 15th, and passed across
the North Sea from E. to W. in almost continuous flocks on the
16th and 17th; and after these dates in more scattered detachments,
less and less to Nov. 19th. And again during the latter,
part of December; the last entry is on Dec. 27th at the Corton,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">-182-</span>
Crows passing E. and W. in afternoon and Larks in hundreds.
Daws are only mentioned at two stations; the Corton on Oct. 10th
and 2:2nd, continuous flocks of Daws and Crows all day; also
at the Shipwash on the 16th. At the Inner Dowsing on Oct. 22nd
four Crows remained all night on globe above the lantern, and five
took up their position in the same quarter on the night of Nov. 8th,
leaving at daylight for the Lincolnshire coast. The wind on the
North Sea on Oct. 16th was N. to N.E., force 4 to 7.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuckoo</span>, <i>Cuculus canorus</i>.&mdash;On Sept. 17th, 10 p.m., at the North
Foreland, wind E., overcast, misty a Cuckoo struck the south
side of the lantern, but was not killed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swallow</span>, <i>Hirundo rustica</i>.&mdash;The spring migration was noticed
at two stations&mdash;the Cockle, June 8th, 9.20 a.m., five Swallows
passed towards land; also on July 1st at 4.30 a.m., ten passing to
W.S.W.; at the South-sand Head, July 6th, twenty at 3.30 a.m.,
flying towards N.N.W. The autumn migration was observed at
several stations both north and south of the Humber. At Coquet
Island, Aug. 15th, midnight, S.E., three Swallows struck glass of
lantern, but were not killed; on the 20th great numbers were seen
flying about, two striking glass after dark, but were not killed.
At Whitby, on Oct. 4th, 9.30 a.m., flock going south. At Hunstanton,
on Sept. 10th, 2 p.m., a flock alighted on lantern and
gallery; and on Oct. 12th, 3 p.m., fog, twelve came up to light and
dispersed in various directions. At the North Foreland, on
Sept. 9th, 10th and 11th, about forty passed each day; and on the
21st, about one hundred flew round the lantern top for an hour.
At the South-sand Head on Sept. 28th, twelve. Swallows passed.
Migration extending from Aug. 15th to Oct. 12th&mdash;fifty-nine days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swift</span>, <i>Cypselus apus</i>.&mdash;The autumn migration of Swifts, so
remarkable in 1879 for the great numbers seen at various places
on the north-east coast (see Zool. Jan. 1880, p. 8), was observed
at only two stations. At Teesmouth, great numbers flying about
during the last three days of August. At the Nore, on Aug. 1st
and 2nd, between 6 and 7 a.m., and again on the 20th; last on
Oct. 10th, 9 a.m., Swifts mixed with Larks. At Heligoland,
Martins and Swifts, "rather great numbers during August; particularly
noted on the 10th, wind S.E., Swifts a great many; on
the 20th, the same."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charadriid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;The burst of severe weather during the early
days in December brought an immense influx of Plovers to our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">-183-</span>
east coast from the north; large flocks are noticed at this time at
the more northern stations, more particularly at Coquet Island
on Nov. 26th and Dec. 6th, northerly and westerly winds, force
from 6 to 8. There is only one notice south of the Humber, and
this early in the season. At the Shipwash, Oct. 12th, flock of thirty
Lapwings, going westward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodcock</span>, <i>Scolopax rusticola</i>.&mdash;Was observed at the Farn
Islands, Oct. 22nd, 30th (great flight), Nov. 1st, Dec. 2nd, N.E.
to N.N.E. At Coquet Island, Sept. 29th, S.W., strong, one; and
Oct. 24th, also one; about noon on both days. At Teesmouth,
Nov. 2nd, three at daylight. At the Outer Dowsing, a station more
than fifty miles from the nearest land, on Dec. 12th, two flying W.
At Heligoland, Oct. 30th, N.N.W., early at dawn, great many
Woodcocks; about 100 killed. Great numbers were shot on the
Yorkshire and Lincolnshire coast on the morning of Oct. 31st,
sixty at Spurn Point alone; wind very fresh from N.E. on the
previous night with drizzly rain. The migration of Woodcocks
extended from Sept. 29th at Coquet Island to Dec. 12th at the Outer
Dowsing&mdash;seventy-five days. The "great flight," at Heligoland
on the morning of Oct. 30th; east coast of England, on the night
of the 30th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snipe</span>, <i>Gallinago media</i>.&mdash;At the Longstone, Sept. 17th, 2.30
a.m., misty, one struck the lantern and was killed. At the Farn
Islands, on Dec. 2nd, 10th and 19th. At the North Foreland, on
Nov. 14th, 1.30 a.m., N., moderate gale, and again on the 21st, at
5 a.m., snow. Snipe were killed. Very large numbers arrived in
Holderness and North Lincolnshire, from the middle to the end
of November, just preceding the outbreak of severe weather in
December. They left the district again, almost to a bird, before
the middle of the month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curlew</span>, <i>Numenius arquatus</i>.&mdash;Curlews were in large flocks at
Teesmouth on Sept. 27th. At the Inner Dowsing, Sept. 1st, three
going from N.E. to S.W. At Hunstanton, on Oct. 13th, 4 a.m.,
fog, one struck glass of lantern and was taken. At the South-sand
Head, Aug. 13th to 29th, large flocks, 100 to 200 in a flock, going
S. and S.W. The Curlew migrates early in the autumn, Aug. 13th
to Sept. 29th. Most of these entries will probably refer to young
birds, the old Curlews coming later in October and November.
At Heligoland, Oct. 30th, many passed over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anatid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Between Dec. 4th and 20th Swans passed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">-184-</span>
Teesmouth from N. to S. in some numbers; on the 4th, six; the
8th, five (four old and one young); 14th, nine (eight old and one
young); 15th, forty-three; 16th, three; 18th, two; the 20th, ten at
10 a.m., and ninety-five at 11 a.m. On the 18th a flock of thirty
was seen near Spurn, one old white bird acting as pilot, the
remainder all young, in the brown plumage. Two Bewick's Swans
were shot on the Humber on the 8th. Four passed the Kentish
Knock, on Dec. 4th, 2.15 p.m., N.E. to S.W. Two Swans, which
may have been "escaped birds" from some private waters, passed
the Teesmouth on Sept. 30th, 10 a.m., flying S.E. Geese were
observed at several stations both north and south of the Humber,
going south from Aug. 18th to Dec. 13th, the main body passing
south during the last half of November and in December. Brent
or "Black Geese" are noted at the Corton, going south, July 18th,
twelve; July 30th, two flocks of from thirty to forty; on Sept. 17th,
thirty. These are very early dates for Brent Geese,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Mr. Cotton,
the observer, might have possibly been led into an error by passing
flocks of black Scoters. As, however, "black ducks" are frequently
mentioned in his return, this could hardly be the case, and he
appears very well able to discriminate between the two. At the
Corton, Dec. 4th, hundreds of black geese from N.E. to S.W. from
sunrise to noon&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, towards the mouth of the Thames or Essex
coast. As might have been expected, large flocks of Ducks are
constantly noted, so frequently indeed, as to defy repetition; this
is more particularly the case in the returns from the lightships.
They are noted sometimes flying S., from the land or to the land,
and in fact in every direction. Many of these would be local flocks
going to and from their feeding grounds. Immense numbers, however,
coming from the north, passed along the coast in November
and December. At Coquet Island, on Dec. 14th, 3 a.m., N.W.,
blowing a gale, two Eider Ducks (spelt phonetically, "Ida" in
the report) struck lantern and one was killed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> Major C. Russell, writing from Essex, says, "The earliest occurrence of Brent
Geese on our coast I ever remember hearing of was Sept. 29th, when many years
ago one of our coast gunners, still living, killed ten at a shot."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Red-throated Diver</span>, <i>Colymbus septentrionalis</i>.&mdash;Red-throated
Divers and Mergansers are mentioned in the report from Teesmouth
during November. With regard to the first of these,
Mr. G&auml;tke sends the following curious note, dated Dec. 22nd,
1879:&mdash;"<i>Colymbus septentrionalis</i>, almost by the million. During
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">-185-</span>
the last forty years there have never, during a single autumn,
been a fiftieth part of what we see here now every day&mdash;all passing
along, principally during the forenoon, east of the island in an E.
by N. direction, which I think they continue till coming to the
Holstein coast, then strike off in a northerly course up to the
extreme north of Jutland, and from thence cross over to the
Dutch coast, perhaps next morning to renew the trip. There are
constantly so many that one scarcely can believe them always to
be fresh birds."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Procellarid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;At the Longstone, on Sept. 18th, at 3 a.m.,
two Petrels were caught against the lantern-windows. At Coquet
Island, on Nov. 4th, 3 a.m., one killed against the lantern. At the
Goodwin, Oct. 11th, five were seen with many Larks and Starlings
round the lantern at night. Greater numbers of Procellaria
glacialis have been seen off Heligoland during the autumn than
has been the case for the last twenty years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Independent of the notes of each species, as already given,
numerous flocks of small birds were seen passing the stations, but
too far distant to determine the species. This was specially the
case at the Spurn, on Dec. 3rd and 8th; at the Cockle, on Oct. 9th;
and at the South-sand Head, on Sept. 20th. At the Kentish Knock,
on Nov. 20th, half-a-dozen small birds came on board at midnight,
which, from the written description in the margin, were probably
Greenfinches. It is, however, impossible to give even a guess at
another species which visited another lightvessel on Sept. 20th,
"Fifty very small birds&mdash;in fact, the smallest of British birds&mdash;like
a Sky Lark, but a deal smaller." From the date, they may
have been either Titlarks or Flycatchers.</p>

<p>No rare migrants have been noticed, but this was scarcely to
be expected. In this respect the budget of notes supplied by that
veteran ornithologist Herr G&auml;tke bears a striking contrast to our
east coast reports. On that small island, so favourably situated
for observation, Mr. G&auml;tke has trained up quite a host of practical
observers, and any rare visitant will have to be very sharp if it
succeeds in escaping detection. Quoting from Mr. G&auml;tke's letter
dated Dec. 22nd, we have, on Sept. 17th, <i>Sylvia fuscata</i>, though
not got; <i>Anthus Richardi</i> on the 18th; <i>A. cervinus</i> on the 20th;
<i>Picus leuconotus</i> on the 21st; then some days S.W. with rain and
no birds; 26th, calm and clear, <i>Emberiza pusilla</i>; 27th, E.N.E.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">-186-</span>
<i>Anthus Richardi</i>, <i>Emberiza pusilla</i> (two shot), <i>E. aureola</i> (seen);
28th, <i>E. pusilla</i> (two seen), <i>E. rustica</i> (one shot); 29th, <i>Sylvia
superciliosus</i> (one); 30th, <i>Emberiza pusilla</i> (one); Oct. 1st, <i>E. pusilla</i>
(one); Nov. 2nd, 3rd and 4th, westerly winds and nothing, but
daily some <i>Parus ater</i>; on the 5th, again, <i>Anthus cervinus</i> (seen
and heard); northerly winds, sometimes N.E. on the 8th, a Leaf
Warbler seen at close quarters, but not procured by Aeuckens,
the Heligoland birdstuffer, which Mr. G&auml;tke feels tolerably certain
was a very rare visitant; the same day there were two or three
<i>E. rustica</i>, and one each of <i>A. pusilla</i> and <i>A. cervinus</i>. The rare
Leaf Warbler was again seen on the 9th, but could not be obtained;
an <i>Emberiza rustica</i> was also seen. On the 10th, <i>E. pusilla</i> shot
and <i>E. rustica</i> seen. On the 12th, <i>Muscicapa parva</i> and <i>Motacilla
lugubris</i>, which latter comes there rarely in autumn. On the 14th,
<i>Sylvia superciliosus</i> was shot by Mr. G&auml;tke's eldest son, and two
more were seen by Aeuckens in a garden where shooting was not
permitted. On the 18th, one very fine <i>E. pusilla</i> shot. On the 20th
<i>Lestris affinis</i> was seen close by, but not shot, as it would have
fallen in the sea and drifted away. This is the third, if not the
fourth, known occurrence of the Siberian Herring Gull at Heligoland.
On the 24th a large Redpoll was shot, which Mr. G&auml;tke
thinks can only be the Greenland bird, <i>Linota Hornemanni</i>.</p>

<p>A summary of the various returns show that four species,
Larks, Starlings, Rooks and Hooded Crows, in the order given
respectively, far outnumber any other, and of these four the Lark
far exceeds the rest in migratory numbers. As a rule, the lines of
migration followed have been from E. to W., or S.E. to N.W.
direct on to the English coast. To the middle of October we find
birds rarely coming from points north of east; after this date they
appear to come occasionally from directions north of east, between
east and due north. The line of migration of the <i>Anatid&aelig;</i> has
been from north to south, crossing the line of the <i>Insessores</i> at
right angles.</p>

<p>There is one remarkable exception to the general rule of an
east to west route in the case of the lightvessel on the Galloper
Bank, forty miles S.S.E. of Orfordness. All entries in this return
show birds passing to the E. or S.S.E. or S.E. during October.
We can only account for this anomalous line by supposing the
birds which cross the Galloper have previously struck the English
coast at some higher latitude, and after skirting the coast line
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">-187-</span>
shot off again somewhere near Orfordness and crossed the North
Sea to the Belgian and French coasts between Nieuport and
Dunkerque. On Nov. 24th a great quantity of Larks and Starlings
passed the Galloper towards the N.N.E, a line which if persevered
in would eventually bring them to the Dutch coast.</p>

<p>At the East-side from the 2nd to the 5th of November flocks of
"Crows" were observed passing from the S. to the N., or from the
French to the Suffolk coast. The great body of the immigrants
during 1879 have crossed at the more southern stations, the four
lightships on the Goodwin Sands, also the Nore, the Shipwash
and Kentish Knock showing a constant and continuous stream
on to the south-east coast. These birds would all cross at the
narrowest part of the North Sea directly from E. to W. to the
English coast. The long prevalence of north-westerly winds in
October and November may to a great extent have deflected the
lines of migration much farther to the south than is generally
the case.</p>

<p>Migrants have passed the stations at all hours of the day and
night, flying at no great altitude and in almost all winds and
weather. When the nights are dark and cloudy, no stars
appearing, in rain, fogs and snowstorms, flocks of birds during
the night migrations will crowd round the lanterns of the lightships;
many strike the glass and are killed, falling on deck or
pitching overboard. On these nights birds will often remain
for hours in the vicinity of a light, circling round and round,
evidently having lost their way; at the first break in the clouds,
the stars becoming visible, or the first streak of early dawn, they
will resume their flight to the nearest land.</p>

<p>The "great rush" of immigrants was from the 12th to the
23rd of October. The "final rush" took place just preceding and
during the first burst of winter, early in December.</p>

<p>The occurrences when birds travel dead to windward are very
rare indeed, and then only with light winds. In the great majority
of cases birds migrate flying within two to four points of the wind,
sometimes with a "beam" wind, or even a point or two "abaft of
beam." If the wind changes during the actual passage, birds will
change the direction of their flight to suit the wind. Thus at the
Shipwash, on Oct. 16th, from 9.50 a.m. to 1.20 p.m. the wind was
N.N.W., flocks constantly passing from S.E. to N.W. from 1.20
to 3.20 p.m. the wind blew from N.N.E., and the birds passed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">-188-</span>
S.S.E. to N.N.W. If subsequent observations should prove the
correctness of this rule, it will go far to account for all the
irregularities of migration&mdash;the "why" birds are seen in great
numbers in one year in any locality, and perhaps absent altogether
in following seasons.</p>

<p>Subsequent to the writing of this report I have received
several communications showing a large and very remarkable
influx of immigrants on to the east coast of England in January
and the first fortnight in February, 1880. On Jan. 24th great
numbers of Fieldfares were seen near Spurn Point, between
Easington and Kilnsea, and since this date they are reported as
very numerous in the locality; with the Fieldfares came many
fine old cock Blackbirds. In North-East Lincolnshire, also, during
the last fortnight in January I saw many very large flocks of
Fieldfares, apparently entirely composed of old birds; before this
time scarcely any had been seen. Mr. G&auml;tke writes from Heligoland:&mdash;"<i>T.
pilaris</i> all January, through night from 10th to 11th,
great many; also Oystercatchers and other waders coming from
the E; also from 21st to 24th, the same." These dates agree
very well with the time of their arrival on our east coast. Short-eared
Owls arrived in some numbers at Spurn in the last week in
January. A very large flock of Snow Buntings was seen on the
8th February. On the Lincolnshire side I noticed an immense
flock of the same species, fresh arrivals, on the 5th; and on the
11th thousands, also hundreds of Larks. This final and third
"rush" of immigrants so late in the winter is curious, and may
perthaps be explained by the comparatively milder winter over
Northern Europe, compared with what we have experienced in
the central and southern zones of Europe. We have indeed a
recent precedent for this in the winter of 1877-78, when, after
a long continuance of mild weather in Scandinavia, a sharp and
sudden outburst of real winter drove the Fieldfares, as Mr. G&auml;tke
says, over Heligoland, on the night from the 27th to 28th January,
in "countless flights."</p>

<h3 id="SEPARATE_REPORT_OF_EACH_SPECIES_OBSERVED_3">SEPARATE REPORT OF EACH SPECIES OBSERVED.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Hawk.</span>&mdash;At Dhuheartach on Oct. 5th, two struck lantern at
8 a.m., light S.E. wind, and haze; and another on the 8th, at
7 a.m., calm, with fog. At Mull of Galloway, on July 18th, a
Sparrowhawk was killed at 11 p.m., S.E., light and calm, thick
haze; and one on Aug. 15th, at 1 a.m., wind variable, light air,
fog and haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Owl.</span>&mdash;I have only two records&mdash;one seen at Dhuheartach on
May 30th, at 4 p.m., wind N.W., fog; and the other at the same
place on Oct. 20th, at 3 p.m., wind E.S.E., fresh, with haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swallow</span>, <i>Hirundo rustica</i>, L.&mdash;The most northerly station
noted this year on our west coast is Rhu Stoir, but two records
here evidently refer to the spring migration, being June 6th and
10th, when two were seen on each day. The most northerly
station noted during the autumn migration is Ardnamurchan;
thence southwards at Skerryvore, Dhuheartach, Rhuvaal, Skervuile,
Rhinns of Islay, and Loch Ryan. The earliest date on
which they were recorded is 29th July, when one was seen at
Dhuheartach at 6 p.m.; wind N., fresh, with clear weather.
The latest record is Sept. 25th, when forty or fifty were seen at
Rhuvaal, at 4 p.m.; wind S.W., fresh, with rain. The length of
time thus occupied by the migration along the west coast of
Scotland was, approximately, fifty-eight days. The greatest rush
took place between the 20th Aug. and 25th Sept.; and, as far as
shown, at Ardnamurchan and Rhuvaal. At Ardnamurchan,
twenty rested all night on Aug. 20th, and left in the morning. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">-191-</span>
Rhuvaal forty to fifty were seen, as related above. Swallows
appeared to migrate principally when the wind is southerly
(S.W. to S.E.), in light, variable, or fresh head- or side-winds,
and hazy weather. Exceptions are found, however, at Dhuheartach
on July 26th, when the wind was N., fresh, and weather
clear; and at Skerryvore on Aug. 17th, when one appeared at
the lantern about 10 p.m. (two hours after lighting up) in a N.W.
light breeze, with showers. Swallows migrate mostly by day,
resting all night. My returns show that they passed at all hours,
but mostly before dark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span>, <i>Hirundo urbica</i>.&mdash;Martins are noticed at two stations
only, <i>viz.</i>, Butt of Lewis and Corsewall. The migration lasted
between July 29th and Aug. 16th, or during eighteen days (but
data are defective). They travelled during the day, resting around
the lighthouses at night, with S. to S.E. and S.W. winds; the
only one killed was when wind was N.N.E., at Corsewall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wren.</span>&mdash;The records are few of this species: usually noticed
on migration in large numbers; they appeared at Monach Island
and Dhuheartach. The earliest date is Aug. 17th, when "some"
struck at 10 p.m., and between that and 3 a.m.; wind W., and
haze. The latest date is Dec. 9th, when one was seen at 3 p.m.,
with S.W. breeze, and showers. In fourteen years Mr. Edgar
never saw a Wren at the Butt of Lewis lighthouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldcrest</span>, <i>Regulus cristatus</i>.&mdash;At Mull of Galloway on July
18th, alighting all night and resting. Mr. Edgar's letter of 20th
Sept. supplies the information that he has never seen Goldcrests
at the Butt of Lewis&mdash;a negative fact of value in tracing their exact
lines of flight. Perhaps in our next reports observers will state
in their remarks if any of the species noticed in this one have
hitherto been rare, or entirely absent from their stations in past
years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin.</span>&mdash;Appeared at Kyleakin, and thence southwards at
Skerryvore, Rhuvaal, Skervuile, Rhinns of Islay, and Corsewall.
The largest number recorded at Corsewall, where fifteen struck
on Sept. 15th, at 11 p.m.; wind S.W., light breeze, and haze.
The earliest date is Sept. 10th&mdash;one at Skervuile, at midnight;
wind S.W., light, and cloudy. The latest is at Rhuvaal, on Dec.
4th at 9 a.m., when one was seen; wind variable, light breeze,
clear. Thus, time occupied is between Sept. 10th and Dec. 4th.
A rush took place in September between 10th and 21st, but no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">-192-</span>
large numbers are recorded; in October another rush between
7th and 18th; on the former date numbers migrated with Larks
and other species not known, and many were killed and fell into
the sea at Skervuile. At Skerryvore one seen at 7 p.m.; wind S.,
fresh, with fog and rain. In September I have records on six
days at four stations; in October two at two stations, and in
December one at one station&mdash;Rhuvaal; they passed or struck
mostly at night or morning, but a few through the day; winds
mostly southerly, and hazy or foggy; a few in cloudy and clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedgesparrow.</span>&mdash;At M'Arthur's Head, on Sept. 28th, one
struck at 1 a.m.; wind N.W., strong, with haze and rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheatear.</span>&mdash;Wheatears or "Stonechecks" are recorded from
Skerryvore as the most northerly station this year, and thence
southward at Rhuvaal, Skervuile, Turnberry, Corsewall, and
Mull of Galloway. The earliest appearance noted is on Aug.
15th, and the latest on Sept. 28th; thus the migration extended
over forty-four days. The greatest rush was between Aug. 17th
and 22nd. The migration took place entirely at night, and
principally with southerly winds&mdash;S., S.W., and to W.; fewer in
northerly or easterly winds. The favoured stations were Skerryvore,
Rhuvaal, and Skervuile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Titmice.</span>&mdash;The negative information that Mr. Edgar never
saw any Titmice at the Butt of Lewis lighthouse is worthy of
record. I have notes of their occurrence at M'Arthur's Head and
Lamlash; in each case a single bird struck the lantern, Nov. 16th
and Aug. 17th, at 6 p.m. and 10 a.m. respectively; both during
west wind, and light air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fieldfare.</span>&mdash;Occurred at Monach Island and Douglas Head,
and is reported as usually seen at Butt of Lewis, though not this
year. At Monach Island a number struck, and fifteen were
killed, between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m., on Oct. 21st and 22nd; wind
S.W., fresh, and drizzling rain. At Douglas Head one was
seen on Oct. 16th, at 10 a.m.; wind N., moderate breeze, and
cloudy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thrush.</span>&mdash;The most northern station is, for 1879, Isle
Ornsay. Mr. Edgar; however, adds the general information that in
most years the Butt of Lewis yields large numbers at the lantern;
thence southward at Skerryvore, Dhuheartach, Rhinns of Islay,
Lochindaul, Lamlash, Corsewall, and Point of Ayre. The
earliest date is Sept. 19th, when a mixed flock of Thrushes and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">-193-</span>
Blackbirds passed in variable winds, and clear, at Lamlash.
The latest date is Dec. 3rd, when "Thrushes" passed Lochindaul
in the "daytime." But this may be due to local influences and
hard frost then registered. The next latest date is Nov. 24th,
when one was seen in the daytime, 2 p.m.; wind N.E., fresh,
clear; this would give sixty-six days for the passage, or, taking
the later date of Dec. 3rd, seventy-six days. The rushes were on
Sep. 19th (<i>ut sup.</i>); a "great rush" Oct. 21st to 28th. On Oct. 21st
at Point of Ayr, two hundred "along with Blackbirds" seen at
1.80 p.m.; wind N. and N.W., strong, clear, with occasional
showers. Also at the Rhinns of Islay, five seen, and so through
records of Oct. 22nd, 18th to 28th, when three hundred "dark
grey birds larger than a common Thrush!!?" (probably Missel
Thrush, <i>Turdus viscivorus</i>) were seen at Point of Ayr; wind
S.S.E., light, and hazy; and at Skerryvore about forty (of which
ten killed) at 7 p.m.; wind S.E., light breeze, and haze.
Thrushes travel with winds from S.E. to S.W. by preference, but
also with winds from W. to N.E., through N.; observed most, as
with most other species at lanterns, in hazy and rainy weather,
but the great rush took place in "clear, with occasional showers,"
and "hazy and fine." Returns show that out of sixteen dates
reported upon, only three show a diurnal migration, but one of
these three is the rush of three hundred "dark grey birds larger
than a common Thrush"<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> on Oct. 28th, at Point of Ayr.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> We shall refer to these under "Birds unknown," but we have thought it
advisable to enter them here also; they can easily be erased in future comparisons
if better data come to hand.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackbird.</span>&mdash;The northernmost locality is Rhuvaal, where
one struck on Dec. 1st, at 2 p.m., wind N.E., fresh; thence
southwards at M'Arthur's Head, Skervuile, Pladda, Lamlash,
Corsewall, Mull of Galloway and Point of Ayr. The earliest
date is Aug. 26th, at M'Arthur's Head. The latest date is
Dec. 1st, at Rhuvaal. The time thus occupied by the migration
was ninety-seven days. The rushes took place between 13th and
21st Oct., and the most favoured locality recorded is Point of
Ayr, where on Oct. 21st two hundred "mixed Thrushes and
Blackbirds" were seen at 1.30 p.m.; wind N.N.W., strong, and
clear, with occasional showers. They were visible at the various
stations in all winds, apparently from W. to E. and from S. to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">-194-</span>
N.N.W. They appeared at all hours of the day and night, but
most of the records apply to night migration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starling.</span>&mdash;The records of the Starling are very general; the
most northern station given is Butt of Lewis, where the remark
is made that they generally strike. This year, however, the most
northern is Ardnamurchan Point, thence southward at Dhuheartach,
Sound of Mull, M'Arthur's Head, Skervuile, Rhinns of
Islay, Corsewall, Portpatrick, Mull of Galloway, and Point of
Ayr. The earliest date on record is Aug. 11th, at M'Arthur's
Head and Loch Ryan; at the former, one struck at 10 p.m., in
S. wind, fresh, with haze; at the latter, two struck at 11.30 p.m.;
wind E., light, with fog. The latest date is Dec. 18th, when one
was caught at Skervuile at 11 p.m.; wind S.W., fresh, with haze.
Thus the time occupied in passage was one hundred and thirty
days, but the last date may have been due to local influence and
keen frost at that time registered. The next latest date is Nov.
23rd, which would make the time spent in passage one hundred
and four days. Rushes took place more frequently than with
most species noted; thus, Sept. 19th, Oct. 12th to 25th, and
Nov. 11th and 17th, may all be characterised as dates of rushes.
The most favoured localities were Corsewall and Portpatrick, for
frequency of records; and Ardnamurchan Point, Dhuheartach,
Portpatrick, and Point of Ayr, for numbers of individuals.
Starlings do not seem to have any choice of wind, as far as
returns show. We find them migrating with N., W., and S.E.
winds in almost equal proportions, with a preference&mdash;but very
slight&mdash;to W. winds. They also pass or strike in E., S., and
N.W. winds, but in fewer numbers. We do not think any
deductions can be drawn from these data. But Starlings breed
at many of the lighthouses or in their vicinity, so it is not always
easy to determine whether, in every instance, they are on
migration or not (as remarked by more than one reporter, <i>e.g.</i>,
Mr. Edgar, at the Butt of Lewis, &amp;c.). Out of seventeen dates
reported on, only three show migration to have taken place
during the day, <i>viz.</i>, at Portpatrick (in two instances), and
Ardnamurchan Point (3 p.m. in a gale).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Finches.</span>&mdash;At Dhuheartach on Aug. 24th, one hundred were
seen and twenty killed between p.m. and 2 a.m., wind N.N.W.,
with haze; on Oct. 4th, six seen in afternoon, wind light and
variable, with clear weather; again, on Oct. 8th, two were killed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">-195-</span>
at 7 a.m., calm, with fog. The above are all the returns of
"Finches."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Linnet.</span>&mdash;Only two records. At Rhuvaal on Sept. 9th, thirty
to forty old and young, were seen around the lantern at 10 a.m.;
wind E. to N., breeze to stormy, with haze; and at Lamlash on
same date and at same hour, fifty were seen; wind fresh breeze
from W., and clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yellowhammer.</span>&mdash;At Lamlash on Aug. 17th, one struck at
10 a.m., in light W. wind, and fog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snow Bunting.</span>&mdash;At Monach Island, farthest north recorded,
and at Dhuheartach and Corsewall. Earliest appearance Sept.
19th, when a flock was seen at Monach Island at noon, with S.W.
light wind, and clear weather. Latest date Dec. 10th, when one
was caught at Corsewall at 10 p.m.; wind variable, light, and
haze; thus, time occupied was eighty-two days. A. rush took
place probably about Sept. 19th, when a flock was seen at
Monach Island,&mdash;but our data are scanty,&mdash;and another about
Nov. 10th, when a flock passed Corsewall. Other dates of record
are Oct. 10th and 18th; they passed in N.W. and N. winds, in
clear or cloudy weather; also in September in S.W., with clear
weather, and variable wind, with clear or haze. All the records
are during the night, except one at 12 noon, at Monach Island
on Sept. 19th; wind S.W., clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lark.</span>&mdash;The most northern station noted this year was
Dhuheartach, and thence southward they are noticed at M'Arthur's
Head, Skervuile, Rhinns of Islay, Lamlash and Corsewall. The
earliest date is Aug. 17th, when twenty struck at Dhuheartach
between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m.; wind W., with haze. The latest
date is Dec. 6th, when one struck at 9 p.m.; wind S.E., fresh,
and haze, at Corsewall; the time thus occupied was one hundred
and twelve days (but the last was no doubt due to the severe
frost inland at that time). The previous date is Nov. 18th,
which would make the time only seventy-nine days. The greatest
rush appears to have been in October, about the 12th to 24th,
but the numbers observed are so small that it is difficult to
judge. The locality most favoured was Dhuheartach, whence I
have returns on eight different dates, between Aug. 17th and
Nov. 24th. An earlier rush took place about Aug. 17th to
21st, at Dhuheartach and Skervuile. A later rush about Nov.
15th to 18th at Dhuheartach, Skervuile, and Rhinns of Islay,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">-196-</span>
but of small dimensions. Larks appear to migrate principally
when the wind is W. to S.W., or late in the season, when still
more southerly, say S. Exceptions occur at Dhuheartach on
Nov. 24, when wind was N.E., fresh, and weather clear; at
Rhinns of Islay on Nov. 7th, wind N.W., light breeze; at
Skervuile on Oct. 10th, when wind was N.; they migrate in calm,
variable, light, or fresh winds, and are noticed at lanterns
principally in haze and fog. They migrate mostly at night, at
all hours, but the majority pass between 7.30 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Those passing during the day were travelling when the wind was
N. or N.E.; those passing at night when the wind was S. to W.
So the returns show; but whether this indicates any <i>law of
migration</i> or not remains to be proved by further observation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lapwing.</span>&mdash;The most northern station which they were
observed to pass at this season was Rhu Stoir; thence southward,
they are reported at Isle Ornsay, Lochindaul, Devaar,
Pladda, and Portpatrick. The earliest date given is Aug. 20th,
when "flocks" were seen during the day in N. wind and clear
weather; the latest is Dec. 11th, when one was killed at Pladda,
at 2 a.m., wind S.E., light breeze, with haze. The next latest
date given is Nov. 14th, when twenty-two were seen at 8.30 a.m.
at Portpatrick, wind S.E., and haze. The time occupied, therefore,
this year is from eighty-six to one hundred and thirteen days.
Rushes took place about the 20th to 25th August, when several
flocks passed Isle Ornsay and Lochindaul; again, Sept. 16th to
25th, a flock at Devaar, Portpatrick and Chickens Rock; another
rush at Rhu Stoir, Portpatrick and Lochindaul about Oct. 27th.
Lapwings travelled in clear or haze, rain, or showers, principally
in S. and S.E. winds, on the west coast; but also in N. wind on
Aug. 20th, and in W. and S.W. at Rhu Stoir and Lochindaul on
Oct. 23rd and Nov. 1st respectively They appear to travel
equally by day and night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plover.</span>&mdash;Three stations give returns of this species, <i>viz.</i>,
Skerryvore, Rhinns of Islay, and Portpatrick. The earliest date
is July 27th, at Portpatrick. The latest date is Oct. 18th, at
Skerryvore. The time thus occupied by the migration was fifty-three
days. The principal rush took place about the beginning
of September, and the favoured station was Portpatrick, where
they were always observed prssing inland with a S. to S.W. wind,
light or strong breeze, during the daytime. Individuals struck
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">-197-</span>
lantern of Rhinns of Islay at night, when wind was N., N.W.,
or S.E.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oystercatcher</span>, <i>H&aelig;matopus ostralegus</i>.&mdash;At Isle Ornsay on
Nov. 18th, one struck at 10.30 p.m.; wind S., light, with haze,
and rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heron.</span>&mdash;At Dhuheartach on Oct. 8th, one seen at 7 a.m.;
calm, fog. At Rhuvaal, Oct. 1st to 30th, "Storks" (afterwards
identified as Herons) passed at 9 a.m.; wind variable, light, with
showers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curlew.</span>&mdash;Island Glass is the most northern station noted
for this species; southwards at Dhuheartach, Pladda, Portpatrick
and the Mull of Galloway. The earliest date recorded is Aug. 3rd,
when eighteen were seen passing Portpatrick at 10 a.m., wind
E.S.E., strong breeze, with haze; the latest date is Nov. 20th,
when eight were seen passing Island Glass, flying southward, at
2 p.m., wind light S.W., with clear weather Thus the time
occupied was one hundred and nine days. A rush took place in
August&mdash;say 3rd to 26th&mdash;and again in November, 15th to 20th.
Dhuheartach seemed to be a favourite station. Curlews migrated
in all winds, and "boxed the compass" from E.S.E., through S.
to S.W., W. and N.N.W.; they passed mostly at night. Two
exceptions were at 10 a.m. on Aug. 3rd, and 2 p.m. on Nov. 20th,
at Portpatrick and Island Glass respectively.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whimbrels</span> ("Small Curlews"), <i>Numenius ph&aelig;opus</i>.&mdash;At
Lochindahl on Sept. 20th, seen for several days in flocks; wind
S. to W., and rainy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sandpiper</span> (sp.?)&mdash;At Rhinns of Islay on Aug. 22nd, one
struck at 1 a.m.; wind S.E., light, and haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turnstone</span>, <i>Strepsilas interpres</i>.&mdash;At Rhinns of Islay on Nov.
8th, one struck at night; wind S.W., fresh, and haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snipe.</span>&mdash;At Isle Ornsay, a single Snipe takes position as the
northernmost recorded at the lighthouses of the west coast in
1879, as late as Oct. 20th, killed at 10 p.m.; wind N., clear.
Thence, records at Skerryvore, Dhuheartach, Rhinns of Islay,
Pladda, Mull of Galloway, and Douglas Head. The earliest date,
Aug. 20th ("sp. not known"), 4 a.m. at Pladda; wind S.E.,
strong breeze, and haze.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> As a doubt occurs, next earliest date&mdash;a
long jump later&mdash;is Oct. 11th at Rhinns of Islay when one was
killed between 12 p.m. and 3 a.m.; wind N., light, with haze.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">-198-</span>
The latest date is Nov. 15th, when, at Rhinns of Islay, sixteen
were killed between 6 p.m. and 4 a.m., wind S., breezes and haze;
and another record occurs at Pladda. Thus from Oct. 11th to
Nov. 15th marks thirty-five days for passage. Snipe are thus seen
to make a rapid passage. (Local migrations occur earlier from
moors to lowland marshes in Scotland, September always
producing home-bred birds in our lowland marshes.) Rush of
foreign birds middle of November, 1879, as far as we can judge;
but on Oct. 18th "numbers" kept about all night round lantern
of Skerryvore; wind S.E., light breeze, fog, and rain. Migration
mostly at night, judging from records, but also by day.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> This may have been a Sandpiper.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodcock.</span>&mdash;The northernmost station on west coast in 1879
is Island Glass; thence southwards at Dhuheartach, Rhinns of
Islay, Lochindaul, Devaar, Corsewall, Mull of Galloway, and
Douglas Head. Small numbers recorded in all cases, except at
Lochindaul, when about forty passed during the daytime on Dec.
12th, when the wind was variable, light, and the weather clear.
The earliest date was Oct. 11th; one killed at Rhinns of Islay at
10 p.m., wind N., light, clear; the latest Dec. 12th. Too few data
to fix rushes, except the one in December, which no doubt was
directly caused by the severe frosts then recorded; wind N. and
W., except on two occasions, on Oct. 7th at Douglas Head, wind
E.; and on Oct. 30th at Mull of Galloway, wind E.; and on two
others, <i>viz.</i>, variable and light, when (in the hard frost) the forty
were seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn Crake</span>, <i>Crex pratensis</i>.&mdash;Heard for first time at Lochindaul,
June 2nd; at Kyleakin, June 9th, wind S.W., clear; and at
Skerryvore, June 20th, wind strong S.E., with fog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wild Geese</span> (sp.?).&mdash;At Monach Island a flock "mixed old
and young" passed south at 10 a.m. on Dec. 13th, wind S.S.W.,
fresh breeze, with haze; this is the most northerly station noted.
Thence southward they were seen at Kyleakin (passing N.W.) at
8 a.m., wind N.W., fresh breeze, and clear weather; also at
Sound of Mull, M'Arthur's Head and Devaar. The earliest date
is Aug. 17th (passing N.W.), and the latest Dec. 15th (twenty-four
passing W., at Sound of Mull). A migratory movement is thus
seen to have extended over one hundred and nineteen days. A
rush took place on Oct. 20th and 21st, at Sound of Mull and
M'Arthur's Head; and again on December 18th, 14th and 15th,
at Monach Island, M'Arthur's Head, and Sound of Mull
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">-199-</span>
respectively; the direction of their flight was usually W. or N.W.
On Dec. 13th a flock passed S.; most passed with a S., S.S.W.
or S.W. breeze, in cloudy or clear weather; in two instances with
a N.W. wind. They were observed during daylight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wild Swan.</span>&mdash;At Devaar on Dec. 11th, six seen at 4 p.m.,
light airs, with haze; and on Jan. 4th, three were seen flying
south, in clear weather, at Rhuvaal lighthouse. We say nothing
of the reported occurrence of <i>Cygnus americanus</i> on our coasts,
but think the record (p. 111) premature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wild Duck.</span>&mdash;At Butt of Lewis a Duck was killed on Dec. 1st,
at 8 p.m., wind E., light and clear. Others occurred in November
and December at Rhuvaal and Devaar. At Rhuvaal, between
Nov. 1st and 30th, three or four hundred Ducks passed between
8 a.m. and 3 p.m.; wind variable, light, and showery weather.
Most of the migration seems to have been observed through the
day. In none of the reports are the species identified, being
described as either "Ducks" or "Wild Ducks."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Widgeon</span>, <i>Anas penelope</i>.&mdash;At Monach Island on Oct. 27th, a
few were seen at 12 noon; wind S.S.E., fresh, and clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheldrake</span>, <i>Tadorna vulpanser</i>.&mdash;At Pladda, on May 23rd,
six (two males and four females) seen at 1 p.m., wind N.E., light,
and haze; remained on the island till the middle of June.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eider Duck.</span>&mdash;At Rhu Stoir on June 30th, two males and
two females seen at 11 a.m.; wind S., fresh breeze, showers. At
Dhuheartach on Dec. 3rd, twenty seen at 10 p.m.; wind N.E.,
light, clear. At Devaar on Dec. 13th, twelve seen at 1 p.m.;
wind N.N.W., light breeze, haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Storm Petrel.</span>&mdash;At Butt of Lewis in July, August, and
September, an occasional bird at the glass, always at night,
always in hazy or rainy weather, generally "haze and rain"
together; wind in three out of four instances S.W., and once on
July 3rd, W.N.W., stormy. At Rhu Stoir a good many were
observed "not on passage" between 17th and 20th Aug. between
6 p.m. and 10 p.m., wind N. to E., light, haze and rain; and at
Rhinns of Islay on Sept. 17th, one struck at 2 a.m., wind S.,
light, and haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sea-fowl.</span>&mdash;The following notes upon sea-fowl as observed at
several stations&mdash;notably at Cape Wrath&mdash;will, we think, prove
interesting:&mdash;At Cape Wrath, Mr. M'Gill reports all the sea-fowl
as deserting their breeding-haunts there on Aug. 16th, and both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">-200-</span>
old and young flying westwards. He roughly estimated the
numbers which passed within his ken as follows:&mdash;300 to 400
Guillemots, 800 to 900 Razorbills, 800 to 900 Puffins, 100 Scarts,
and 300 Sea-gulls. This was performed in an east wind, during
hazy or rainy weather (see also under Solan Goose), and all left
Cape Wrath in one day and about the same time, <i>viz.</i>, 10 a.m.
The Gulls passed continuously between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
Notes from other stations can hardly be considered as applying
to anything but local daily migration in search of food, as is
constantly witnessed at any rock-bird station on the coast; thus,
at Rhu Stoir large numbers passed towards S.W., and are
specially noted on June 12th to 15th; also at Kyleakin, a large
flock passed southward at 2 p.m., wind S.E. When at the Shiant
Isles this summer, at the end of June, I witnessed a regular
departure of thousands of Puffins to their feeding-grounds in the
Little Minch, about 9 to 10 a.m.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sea Gulls.</span>&mdash;At Cape Wrath on Aug. 10th, three hundred
passed west between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.; wind E., haze, and rain.
"Sea Gulls bred at the station, and all left on the same day, both
young and old. The migration goes all to the west."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kittiwake</span>, <i>Rissa tridactyla</i>.&mdash;At Skervuile on May 31st, two
at noon flying north; calm, clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tern.</span>&mdash;At Dhuheartach, six seen on the evening of Aug. 27th,
wind S., cloudy; and four at the same station on the morning of
Sept. 4th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birds unknown.</span>&mdash;At Portpatrick on July 12th, a flock of
small birds passed overhead at 8.30 a.m., wind S.S.E., fresh,
and rainy; and on Oct. 13th a flock passed inland at 4.20 p.m.,
wind S.W., and rain; on Nov. 13th "a flock of birds not known"
passed inland, wind E. by N., and clear. At Pladda on Aug. 20th,
one Snipe, species not known, at 4 a.m., wind S.E., strong, and
haze; and another on Nov. 15th. At Skervuile, on Nov. 14th,
a number from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., wind variable, light, and haze;
and others on Oct. 7th at Skervuile; "many killed and fell into
the sea."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red-breasted Merganser.</span>&mdash;At Corsewall, on July 20th, a
"strange Duck" (since identified as a Red-breasted Merganser)
was killed at glass at 2 a.m.; wind E., light, with haze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solan Goose</span>, <i>Sula bassana</i>.&mdash;At Cape Wrath and other
stations upon our coasts, an extraordinary annual migration of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">-201-</span>
Solan Geese is witnessed. Mr. M'Gill has reported to me
specially on that of 1879, and kept as accurate a record as
possible of the numbers which he estimated to pass westward.
He writes as follows:&mdash;"The number of Solan Geese that
migrate past Cape Wrath is beyond anyone's power to number,
but I have come as near to it as possible. The first half of July
the flocks were composed of old birds, and the rest of the time
they were mixed old and young." Mr. M'Gill then gives the
following list of Solan Geese seen passing west on fifteen days,
between 14th July and 9th August, which I reproduce here:&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that from 2150 to 3080 were estimated to
pass westward within view of Cape Wrath, between July 14th and
August 9th, during fifteen days occupied on migration. All
which were observed passed during the day&mdash;say between 7 a.m.
and 10 p.m.&mdash;and apparently in all winds and weather. From
the Butt of Lewis Mr. Edgar supplies the general information
that the Solan Geese pass the station, arriving first in May, and
leaving in the latter end of October, but giving no particulars as
to direction of flight. At Mull of Galloway Solan Geese are
reported as passing, on July 19th, in flocks. Mr. N. B. Morrison
reports as follows:&mdash;"Saw them flying past to W.S.W. in wedge-shaped
flocks as if on a passage, or changing locality." This was
during the forenoon; wind S., light, and haze. "At 1 p.m. it
began to rain, and continued for twenty-four hours; rain guage
at 9 a.m. of 20th, 1&middot;72 inches. On 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 24th,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">-202-</span>
very strong breeze, and showers; wind W.N.W. to S.W." Again
at same station (Mull of Galloway) flocks continued passing all
day; wind S.E., fresh, fog, and rain, flying in same direction.
On 8th and 9th, wind S., gale; 10th, wind W., strong. In a
later note Mr. M'Gill believes "that the Solan Geese strike the
land first at Cape Wrath," and that the Geese which pass it are
from Suliskerry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the west coast of Scotland, also, many observers make
particular mention of the scarcity of autumnal migrants in 1879.
At several principal and important stations this scarcity is of
course most remarked upon, such as Butt of Lewis, Monach
Island, Island Glass, Skerryvore, and Dhuheartach. During long
experience at these and other stations, the several observers do
not remember such great scarcity of birds during the autumn
migration. From other observers' remarks it would appear that
several of the west coast stations are not suitable for observations
being made, from their land-locked situations or other local
influences, such as Kyleakin, Sound of Mull, Corran Ferry, and
others.</p>

<p>Many birds are killed at the lanterns of the more isolated
lighthouses and are blown into the sea. Thus, in 1877, at
Skerryvore, in the month of October, the number of birds killed
was six hundred, chiefly the Common and "Mountain Thrush"
(Ring Ouzel), but including also Blackbirds, Snipes, Larks, and
one Wild Duck. The observer, Mr. W. Crow, was of opinion
that about two hundred more were killed and blown into the sea.
They came every night from the 1st to the 6th, about 8 p.m.,
and went away at daylight. "I would estimate," he says, "the
number about the light on each of the above nights to be about
a thousand." The direction of the wind was from S.S.E. to S.,
with haze; and no migration of birds was observed during the
day. On Dhuheartach lighthouse rock, "two Hawks are seen
every morning" while the migration lasts, which come to prey
upon the small birds resting on the rock. A considerable flight of
migrants took place about Oct. 7th, as upon the east coast.</p>

<p>The direction of the flight of migrants appears to be from
east to west at the north coast stations, but from N.W. and
N.N.W. to S.W. or S.S.W. at the stations farther south; and
this is borne out by previous observations in former years by my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">-203-</span>
west coast observers at Tyree and elsewhere. Our observers
have not usually reported the direction taken by the migrants,
but there are enough data to prove the above lines. It would
appear, therefore, that birds when passing from east to west
often overshoot the land, and are compelled to turn back upon
a new course, according to the direction of the wind. In
1878, Mr. W. Boyd (since deceased) wrote regarding the migration
in Mull as follows:&mdash;"In the month of October I was
fishing on Loch Assapol, near Bunessan. Almost every day
I saw flock after flock of little birds&mdash;Larks, Buntings, Robins,
and even Wrens&mdash;flying across the loch. All these birds were
steering the same course, having apparently come from the
outlying Hebrides, <i>vi&aacute;</i> Tyree, Iona, up the Rose of Mull, and
were steering for the mainland. Fresh arrivals of different
species of Ducks rested and then passed on. Wild Swans and
Geese were seen far up in the air, all taking a bee-line for the
south." On another occasion Mr. Boyd visited Tyree in
December, 1878, and both he and a companion remarked "the
extraordinary scarcity of common birds, and the unusual number
of winter visitors." One day every Snipe they put up, instead of
flying a bit and settling again, rose high in air, and went off due
south-east as far as they could see, right across the sea, to Mull.
The remark was then made, "The sooner we go south for powder
and provisions the better; we are going to have an arctic winter,"
which, as is well remembered, was a perfectly correct surmise.
It will thus be seen that the flights of wildfowl almost invariably
are from N. to S. on both coasts, but that the smaller birds&mdash;land
birds&mdash;as they fly lower, are more influenced by the
configuration of the coast-lines, and also, no doubt, by the
direction of the wind at the time. Our data are at present too
scanty to lay down with precision the minuti&aelig; of their lines of
flight, but another year's observations will probably greatly assist
us. The same rules, as to time of day or night at which birds
strike the lantern, holds upon the west coast which also obtain
on the east, and the same remarks as to weather also hold good.</p>

<p>The above remarks upon the direction of the flights upon our
west coast may prove of value in a comparison with Mr.
Cordeaux's notes upon the direction of the flights at the
Galloper Bank. We are aware here that birds pass overland on
migration, crossing Scotland between the Firths of Clyde and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">-204-</span>
Forth, as they have been heard on calm nights crying as they
passed over from W. to E., or from points N. of W. to points S.
of E.; and day-flights have often been observed passing here
from N.N.W. towards S.S.E., or from N.W. to S.W. I would
instance here Bramblings, <i>Fringilla montifringilia</i>, natives of
Northern Europe. (See Gray's 'Birds of the West of Scotland,'
p. 137. The "column" of Bramblings there described as on
migration were not "proceeding in a north-easterly direction,"
however, as stated by Mr. Gray, but were coming from a north-westerly
direction, and were proceeding in a south-easterly
direction.)</p>

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
